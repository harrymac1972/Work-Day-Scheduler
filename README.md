# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The intent of this project is to have a Code Quizz web app to test one's knowledge.

The user has can put their initials in the High Score Board that is saved on local storage.

What I learned from this project is how to create and append dynamic HTML content.

I learned that I'd make more generic container Divs in the HTML for quick removal / re-appending to refresh content.
Note that I did this with the reInitMain() function.  However, next time, I'd take that concept a bit further.

Further, I'd start with only dynamic content on the home page as well.  Placing only generic divs in the original HTML.

Note:  I'm looking forward to knowing how to structure Javascript in classes for the sake of all the Global Variables,
    structure, and readability.
